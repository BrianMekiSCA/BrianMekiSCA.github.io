1. What might be the best location to setup their venture?
2. What goods might be worthwhile selling?
3. Who are the customers likely to bring most business to the shop?

# How to Prepare a Responce
As a data scientist, it first imperative to understand the business needs clearly as this will significantly influence the type of data sourced and used to address the issue.
Said data could be collected first-hand or obtained from existing sources.
For the situation hypothesized above, this existing [Istanbul Customer Shopping Data]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset) suffices to provide rudimentray yet data-driven answers to the questions posed.
